Today, I’m going to reveal the secrets of how an individual investor named Wonyyotti earned around 300 billion won solely through cryptocurrency investments. Wonyyotti began investing in cryptocurrencies in 2017 with about 6 million won and, in just four years, accumulated assets worth 300 billion won. Let’s explore in detail how Wonyyotti turned 6 million won into 300 billion won.

	1.	Wonyyotti’s Trading Strategy

First, let’s look at Wonyyotti’s trading strategy. He focused primarily on chart-based trading. He believed that trading based on good news was only accessible to those who could get the information first, so he relied on charts instead. His main strategy was analyzing charts to understand the market sentiment. By examining the charts, he grasped the market’s overall direction and developed his trading strategy accordingly. Through chart analysis, he accurately predicted trends and adjusted his positions to match the rise and fall. He also prioritized support and resistance lines, using them to decide on the timing of buying and selling.

	2.	Flexible Trading Based on Market Conditions

Second, Wonyyotti responded flexibly to changes in market conditions. When news emerged that could heavily impact the crypto market, he assessed that if the market sentiment was strong, even negative news wouldn’t affect it much, and the market might keep rising. Conversely, if the market sentiment was weak, even good news would have little impact, making a decline more likely. This flexibility in trading according to market conditions was key. He had an excellent ability to read market trends, referencing various economic indicators and news to get a sense of the big picture. He quickly adapted to market changes and adjusted his positions accordingly.

	3.	Situational Stop-Losses over Mechanical Stop-Losses

Third, Wonyyotti set stop-losses when the market strayed from his initial scenario. His stop-loss decisions were part of a well-thought-out plan, and he set stop-loss levels in advance, executing them without letting emotions interfere. This was based on his investment philosophy of strict risk management.

	4.	High Win Rate with Low Leverage for Risk Management

Fourth, Wonyyotti focused on maintaining a high win rate with low leverage and compounding his returns. He believed that achieving a high win rate was essential to investment success. Rather than aiming for a big win, he made steady profits of 1-2% daily, utilizing the power of compound interest. Over three years, he achieved an average daily return of 0.87%, turning 6 million won into 60 billion won. He was cautious with leverage, understanding that high leverage could bring substantial returns but also considerable risk. By using low leverage, he built stable gains over time.

	5.	Thorough Capital Management

Finally, Wonyyotti’s capital management strategy. For solid risk management, he recommended buying and selling in portions. He advised against doubling down impulsively and warned beginners against averaging down on losses. Wonyyotti emphasized that the most crucial aspect of investing is not to lose capital. To this end, he always divided his capital, minimizing risks by investing in portions.

	6.	Wonyyotti’s Chart Techniques

Now, let’s explore Wonyyotti’s chart techniques. Wonyyotti practiced chart analysis daily, mastering risk management to become an expert. He used charts to read market participants’ psychology rather than merely analyzing patterns. He mainly traded high-market-cap coins and always referred to Bitcoin charts when trading altcoins. Instead of relying heavily on additional indicators, he focused on candlestick patterns and moving averages to anticipate trends and market changes. When analyzing charts, he didn’t just look at patterns; he interpreted the psychology of market participants behind them. He believed that charts reflect market participants’ psychology. Thus, he devised his trading strategy by observing the market’s flow and the participants’ sentiment. He also stressed that chart analysis should always go hand-in-hand with risk management. To achieve this, he consistently created detailed plans and traded accordingly.

In conclusion, we have explored Wonyyotti’s secrets to success. His thorough preparation, analysis, and risk management were the keys to his remarkable achievements.
